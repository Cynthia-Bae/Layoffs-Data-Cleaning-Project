# Layoffs-Data-Cleaning-Project
Cleaned and transformed a raw layoffs dataset to produce an analysis-ready table showing standardized company names, consistent locations, calculated layoff percentages, and clean date fields. The process removed duplicates, handled nulls/blanks, normalized text and date formats, and prepared staging tables for downstream analytics and dashboards.
